<p>I am a first-year graduate student at the the University of Michigan's School of Information. I am currently on the Digital Curation mastery path, which I am very excited about.
Before graduate school, I attended Hope College, where I majored in English Literature and history.
After I graduated from Hope, I worked a variety of odd jobs before I interned at Quicken Loans as a data analytics intern.
I then moved on to a role as a Research and Communications Specialist at the non-profit Economic Alliance for Michigan.
I am currently living in Ann Arbor with my fiancee, Lindsay, and am very excited for the semester ahead.
